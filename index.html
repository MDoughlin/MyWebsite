<p class="Change">   Thanks for coming to my page! My name is Micheline and I was born and raised in Boston but I am a West Indian through
  and through. In 2019, I took a leap of faith and bought a one way ticket to Barbados and spent 10 months living with my grandmother on a farm.
  The best way to describe those months were intereting  but I wouldn't change a thing that happened.  Even though you will always find me in Barbados I am also of Jamaican heritage.
  I have always wanted a website or to put myself out there but it gives me serious anxiety but let's let this be the first step.

<h2 id="Fitness"> Fitness &#127947;&#127999;  </h2>
<p class="Change"> For the last 5 years fitness has played a huge role in my life. When I started it was just something to do
  then I set a goal to look like Bria Myles, which happened, but I slowly became my own goals and started to
  really challenge myself and it has paid off.  Because I love fitness so much I became a Certified Personal Trainer
  and now help countless women transform into their best self</p>
